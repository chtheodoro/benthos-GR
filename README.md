### benthos-GR

A benthic-macroinvertebrate benchmark dataset collected from May 2015 to October 2015 in 6 Greek rivers. It consists of 380 microhabitat observations (combinations of flow velocity, water depth, substrate type and water temperature). Each microhabitat sample is related with habitat suitability, calculated using benthic-invertebrate metrics.
